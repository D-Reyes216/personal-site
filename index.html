         I recently enrolled in a Software Engineering class because I want to become a software developer. This website 
        is a work in progress and was made to show my current ability to myself and to others who might be interested in
        what I am capable of. On this site you will find my hobbies, interests, and current capabilities with web development.

          I tried going to school to learn programming before but some things came up and I was unable to continue to pursue
        that career path. I thought about pursuing other options including 3d art(which you can see some of in this website)
        but ultimately I wish to once again pursue a career with computers and programming. Now, years after my initial attempt 
        I am trying again, and with this second chance I hope to be able to reach my goals.
